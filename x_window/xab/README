[Introduction]

This is xab, an abbreviation software for X.


[Installing]

libxtst-dev libx11-dev

To compile type:
make


[Warning]

This software actually grabs everything you type
and could be easily (mis)used to record everything.
You should not use the software if you do not
trust the author or do not understand the code.


[Licence]

Licenced unter GNU-GPL v3 or later.


[Capturing]

There are some ways to capture all keyevents.

- One would be to make a window and grab all keyevents.
  STATUS: Implemented

- One would be to use the XRecord async extension.
  But this uses massively CPU Power, at least in the
  way xmacrorec2 does it (because XRecordProcessReplies
  does not block).
  STATUS: Implemented

- One would be to use the XRecord extension in a
  blocking way.
  STATUS: Next Feature

- One would be to use /dev/input/event*, which is linux
  specific and maybe needs some work to get to keycodes.
  Another problem is that you need access to that files,
  which are normally reserved for root.

- One would be to sniff the network (tcp or socket) and
  get all XEvent packages. You need to be root to have
  such access to the network.


[Ideas]

Provide a plugin system, where
plugins can register for all input events.
